      <p>This project of my creation, titled: LAYERONLAYERONLAYER, is a remake of the Net Art project titled SKINONSKINONSKIN which was a site created by artists Auriea Harvey and Michael Samyn containing a series of digital love letters sent between the two in 1999. Sarah and I decided to create similar sites together which took inspiration from and, in some ways, mimicked Harvey and Samyn's project containing love letters, photos, and love gifs that relate to our own personal character. Each of our sites is unique to us but follows the same basic structure. This idea came about when reading Quaranta's essay. A key point that stuck with us was the fact that Net Art was for everyone, it was free, without restrictions, for people to use. So we took and used. We used the structure of SKINONSKINONSKIN and made it our own. For comparison, here is a link to the Net Art Anthology project SKINONSKINONSKIN: </p>
